# Quant-python

## introduction
This project is a collection of short python programs I wrote during bootcamp.

## python basics
We learned about python datatypes, if-elif-else conditionals, for and while loops, lists and tuples, and list comprehensions.

Here is my [basics Jupyter Notebook](http://https://github.com/MadMaple/Quant-python/blob/master/python-basics-notebook-empty.ipynb).
